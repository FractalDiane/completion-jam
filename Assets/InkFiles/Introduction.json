What inspired you to visit our realm, and a pediatrics clinic no less?","\n",{"#":"char Af"},"^Lost a bet. Just a heads up, the smug jerk that won will likely be watching from hell.","\n",{"#":"char Dr"},"^Right. Well, while you're here, please sign this.","\n",{"#":"char Af"},"^A contract? Bit old fashioned, but it seems you know your stuff.","\n",{"#":"char Dr"},"^Roommate at uni was a witch, I picked up a thing or two about demons.","\n",{"#":"char Af"},"^Let's see...no harm to children, clinic staff...limited use of demonic powers...fair enough. You have my word.","\n",{"#":"char Dr"},"^Excellent. Since you aren't a trained nurse, you'll be helping me manage the children and occasionally fetching me some things.","\n",{"#":"char Af"},"^Will my being a demon cause any trouble?","\n",{"#":"char Dr"},"^Oh, the kids will be terrified at first, but I think it will be exciting for them. How many kids can say they got treated by a demon? Worst case scenario, you standing in the corner might get them to sit still long enough for a shot.","\n",{"#":"char Af"},"^Like a good cop, bad cop type of thing.","\n",{"#":"char Dr"},"^Af, we aren't dealing with criminals.","\n",{"#":"char Af"},"^No, we're dealing with worse- children.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
